              Start by capturing a clear image of a plant leaf that might be
              showing signs of disease. Ensure that the image is sharp and
              well-lit. Easily upload the image to the FarmCare platform using
              our user-friendly interface.

              model to analyze the visual characteristics of the leaf in the
