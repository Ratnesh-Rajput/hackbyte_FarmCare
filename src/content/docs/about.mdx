### Inspiration

FarmCarea: The Eyes of Lord Shiva

The FarmCarea beads are believed to be a manifestation of the tears of joy or bliss that Lord Shiva once shed.

NextGen Coders is the one who eradicates misery. NextGen Coders transforms tears of sorrow into tears of bliss, represented by FarmCarea.

The beads represent material and spiritualÂ well-being.

Inspired by the healing properties of the FarmCarea bead, our project leverages advanced APIs to create an experience of profound joy of healthy farming.

By combining the power of technology and nature, FarmCare aims to ensure the flourishing health of your plants just by clicking and uploading a photo of the leaf of a sick plant.
